# CS261-Data_Structures
Portfolio project for CS261 at Oregon State University


Part 1 of the portfolio project involved completing hash map implmentation. The hash map used a hash table of buckets, each containing a linked list of hash links. Each hash link stores the key-value pair and a pointer to the next link in the list. A skeleton code was provided as a starting point and included classes for DynamicArray and LinkedList. Also in the skeleton code were function definitions with no bodies that needed to be completed for this assignment.


Part 2 of the project involved completing min heap implementation. A dynamic array was used to implement the complet binary tree heap in which each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of the node. Once again, skeleton code was provided as a starting point. 


For more in depth instructions for either part, see the PDF.


Result: 95/95
